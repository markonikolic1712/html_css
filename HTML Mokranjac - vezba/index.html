		<h2>Biography</h2>

		<p></p>He was born in <a href="https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD">Negotin</a>. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name Mokranjac (literally: resident of Mokranje).
		He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade. 
		In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. After a brief break, 
		he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in 1884. 
		Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the Kornelije Stankovic choir of Belgrade.</p>

		<p>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the 
		conductor of the Belgrade singing society (Belgrade Choir). From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, 
		and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija (Belgrade Theological College) where he taught church singing. 
		Together with Stanislav Binicki and Cvetko Manojlovic, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school
